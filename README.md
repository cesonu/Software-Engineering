System Description:
The Ride-Hailing Application is a digital platform designed to connect passengers seeking transportation services with drivers available to offer them. It ensures a seamless experience by supporting features like real-time ride requests, transparent pricing, and secure payment processes. Additionally, the platform offers administrators tools to monitor operations, maintain safety standards, and resolve disputes efficiently.

The application caters to three primary actors: passengers, drivers, and administrators. Passengers can register on the platform, request rides, make payments, and review their ride history. Drivers register and manage their availability, accept ride requests, and track their earnings. Administrators oversee the system’s operations, ensuring that drivers are verified, complaints are resolved, and the platform remains compliant with local regulations.
